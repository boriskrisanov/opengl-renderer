# OpenGL Renderer / Game Engine

This project was initially meant to be a game engine, but I'm currently just using it to learn OpenGL and focusing on rendering. It has gone through several iterations, and currently supports textures, OBJ mesh loading, skyboxes, and simple lighting, with collision detection being worked on. The current iteration uses an ECS architecture, but I plan to refactor this in the future.
